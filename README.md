## ICLR 2021 Stats & Graphs
### Usage
Play with the authors & affiliations data in their respective `csv`s, or run the ipython notebook `iclr2021_stats.ipynb` for the results below. I have also included a direct script for scraping OpenReview with selenium at `scrape_openreview_from_csv.py`.

### Acknowledgments
The file `iclr_results_final.csv` is from @SergeyI49013776's spreadsheet on final ICLR results at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n58O0lgGI5kI0QQY9f4BDDpNB4oFjb5D51yMr9fHAK4/edit#gid=1546418007. 

Also, take a gander at last year's repo on ICLR 2021 stats by @shaohua0116 at https://github.com/shaohua0116/ICLR2020-OpenReviewData. A diff between the two years would be very cool â€” especially if it's enough to see any shifts. A decade might be more realistic to see meaningful shifts. ;)
